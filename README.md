As an accomplished sales professional transitioning into Business Intelligence Analysis, I bring a unique perspective to data-driven decision-making, supported by a Bachelor of Science in Biological Sciences and four years of problem-solving experience in sales. In my previous roles, I utilized Tableau, SQL, and Power BI to analyze complex datasets, identify key customer demographics, and recommend strategic marketing trends. My ability to educate clients on product usage and simplify technical jargon ensures clear communication of data insights, driving stakeholder understanding and informed decision-making. Currently, I am working on my final project at TripleTen, focusing on advanced data analytics techniques. This blend of sales acumen and data analysis expertise positions me to enhance business performance and optimize customer lifecycle experiences.
